## Problem Definition

- JU Query application mainly focuses on promoting virtual interactions and help each and every
student to know what is exactly going on the college campus. So our application is defined as
software that allows any student to ask/answer any query, post any content, share notes and
share their important speeches. 
- Our system will be consist of one front end components and a
backend component. The front end component is for students to view the Q&A, upload Q&A,
share notes and register events. The backend component is to store and maintain the data of
every student profile.

## Abstract

- The web development has undergone many changes and updates since its inception and people
are opting in more for the web development. After the development of ‘web development of
that application’, students are extensively making project of web development. This leaves the
conventional and traditional methods of software development in a state of void. That said,
some beginners and start-ups face difficulties since with recent upgrades the web development
field is becoming complex. The Internet provides multiple vague solutions for entirely
undirected questions on the same. Developers are confused even more so.

- To answer this need, ‘JUQuery’ introduces a set of facilities which facilitates infrastructure of
college. This improves students’ knowledge about campus and at the same time it inform about
any events is going on in campus.

---

## Introduction
- Nowadays ‘Question answer’ website has a huge impact on society and people especially
students. To gain more knowledge on specific category or subject, a portal for posting queries
and getting answers will be a good choice. Our application provides a chance for others to read
queries, analyze them, and choose the true answer based on highest voting.
- “JUQuery” web application is a way for everyone to express their ideas and queries on various
topics like “technology, technical events, innovation, placements, sports, cultural events,
transportations, hostel life, canteen, and many other things” happening in Jain University. It is
an exclusive question answering web application for our university students, teachers, alumni,
and for those who want to know about it. Each question answer is saved in our application
frequently and they will be arranged in about 10 categories as of now. This portal will allow
the users to engage with the presenter and the content of the presentation. The more
engagement, the better the presentation.
- “When handled well, Q&A–questions and answers–becomes the most important element
of a presentation.” - Christopher Witt

## Overview

- In JU Query application it continuously provides the platform for information sharing and
studying. The more you ask doubts the more you learn .it is the environment for everyone can
showcase their knowledge assets and that will use full for everyone who wants to know.
- JU Query allows you to engage in meaningful conversations with your target audience and
establish your brand as an expert in your field. The ultimate goal of this website is just to spread
the knowledge and to help the people who are seeking the knowledge.
- For example a student from a rural area wants to take an admission from our college, he wants
to know about the food items available in canteen. officially he can’t ask that ; In these type of
situation we are understanding the importance of our JUQuery application by using it he can
add query then seniors or others who knows will answer his query and clarify his doubts.
- Everyone has to first register to our website for accessing the platform. Coming to the business
area also it will be a success full project.
-Asking questions or expressing doubts and requesting information leads to knowing
completely about any topic that we are interested to know about. And in every Educational
Institute, there is an actually different perspective on things that are there on the institute:
	- Management Perspective
	- Student Perspective
- But students who are in the institute always want to know both perspectives. And only through
the virtual way we can able to connect to all the students of the Institute and make them get to
know completely about what they wanted to know.
- “JU Query” is a platform to know about the academic and non-academic environment, campus
life of a student and faculty and student relationship in the institute. Any student who is part
of the institute can have an account on this application and can post any questions and can
answer any of the questions posted by other users.

---

## Objectives
- “JU Query” aims to deliver a guide which answers to the demand of a general yet centralized
idea or a suggestion which could address and possibly solve the query about the various field
of Jain University, making the overall work flow easy for the entire management and
functionality teams. So this project although addresses issues which could not only help the
student of Jain University but the other who wants to know about Jain University infrastructure.
- This guide is crafted carefully to bring out the best adopted standard development technique
which is Agile development and used it to smoothen the end users experience in posting the
questions and answers and also see about already posted questions and answers without any
confusion.
- Our next work is to add chat option for it as a student and talk with their seniors to come to
know about some untold queries. Also going to add event creation features on it.

---

## Methodology
This guide proposes a step-by-step guide with a model case following which provides a solution
for issues related to query about Jain University infrastructures. Here is an overview of
problems faced and how its model provides solution to those problems:
- First and foremost, there is no standard application to know about Jain University’s nonacademic
things/ events. This guide simplifies it by breaking down the major steps and
combining issue prone steps with it. The model is a step by step process which eases the
pain of self-searching unknown troubleshooting issues.
- There is always a growing confusion on where to get the non-academic details and
infrastructure about any college. The guide’s presented model, has included a specific ask
query panel as one of its initial steps which is used to post question directly to question
feed and will make it visible and answerable every users of this application. For instance,
consider user needs to know a certain question-A of section AA then it will show the
section-AA at top of the question with user details and timestamp and below of it, it will
display the question.
- It also have an answer button in the rightmost of the question. After clicking on it, it will
open a modal to post the answer. After posting answer by so many users, the latest answer
will be displayed on top of answer feed.
- Being a user of the application they have authority to post and answer queries in ethical
manner. They can sort out the section by clicking on the sidebar’s options.
- To prepare this guide, various models like waterfall, spiral, V model etc. were studied and
some flaws were highlighted that have been traditionally passed down by those models.
- Next, this guide makes sure Agile principles are implemented. This enabled the members
working on the project to track and manage issues and sprints in real time and become
more aware of Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) during the phase of 1 year
lockdown due to the recent COVID-19 widespread. Even though none of them could
physically meet, Agile Scrum principles allowed them to stay in sync and track progress
with each element that were distributed amongst the development team members. So with
everything being stated this guide and the project supports agile principles is completely in
sync with it.

## Hardware and Software used
- Since the project in itself is whole and sole based on use of firebase platform, it is an
acknowledgement as well as a sense of stating the obvious, that the hardware requirements are
bare minimum.
Have a look at the Hardware requirements for the project:
- The Hardware is required to test and run things locally before committing changes to the
main team branch on Firebase.
-  All though not compulsion but each developer needs to own a Laptop/PC where he/she can
work on.
-  A bare minimum configuration of 2 GB RAM with 10+ GB of free disk space would be more
than sufficient.
- Operating Systems are user preference. Whichever OS the user is comfortable with can be
used.
- The Laptop/PC configurations aren’t much stressed. Any configuration machine whether old
or now heavy or lite doesn’t matter. One needs it run code and open websites that’s all.
 A good internet connection is required. A low latency connection on development machine
is always welcomed and appreciated. However, since the project deals with Firebase and web
applications, the software requirements seem to be more. Have a look at the Software
requirements for the project.
- GitHub Software and local Git repository should be present in the machines.
- Knowledge on application development.
- Knowledge on developing applications.
- Text/Code Editor: Atom or Visual Studio Code
- Web Browser with scripting enabled.

---

## Here’s the learning curve:
- Front-End Design languages
- Knowledge about Firebase
- Interaction between Firebase-client
- Firebase query handling
- Command-Line
- Deployment Testing

## Literature Survey

### Reference 1 - Research paper on SocialQ&A: An Online Social
**Network Based Question and Answer System**

- The primary objective of this paper is to improve the performance of Q&A systems by actively
forwarding questions to users who are capable and willing to answer the questions. The
research paper describes the design, architecture, algorithms, implementation of SocialQ&A
(an online social network based Q&A system), and comprehensive large-scale simulation to
evaluate SocialQ&A in comparison with other methods. The paper also emphasises on the
implementation of a real prototype of SocialQ&A, and detailed analysis of the Q&A behavior
of real users and questions from a small-scale real-world SocialQ&A system.

- SocialQ&A leverages the social network properties of common-interest and mutual-trust friend
relationships to identify an asker through friendship who is most likely to answer the question,
and enhance the user's security. SocialQ&A also improves with security and efficiency
enhancements by protecting user privacy and identifying, and retrieving answers automatically
for recurrent questions. The results suggest that social networks can be leveraged to improve
the answer quality and asker’s waiting time.

- Limitations of the reference
	- The implementation of a social network based Q&A system is complex and demands
	  more time and resources to be spent over design and development of the platform.

---

### Reference 2 - Research paper on Facilitating Students’ Collaboration and Learning in a Question and Answer System.

- The research paper describes the design ideas embodied in Green Dolphin (GD), a novel
educational question and answer board with a social web interface that crowd-sources the task
of answering technical questions for students in introductory programming courses. While GD
has some commonalities with existing systems such as Stack Overflow and Piazza, it also has
several distinctive features that set it apart, such as automatic student expertise identification
and code assessment, and delaying the publication of expert answers to encourage student
participation.

- These features are designed to increase student participation, collaboration and sense of
ownership. Students gain new knowledge from the flow of questions and answers in the system.
They develop communication skills by asking and answering questions as well as programming
and debugging skills.

- Limitations of the reference
	- The Green Dolphin platform limits the user audience only to students who are either good
	  at programming or learning how to program through courses.

---

### Reference 3 - Research paper on Wisdom in the Social Crowd: an Analysis of Quora.

- Efforts such as Wikipedia have shown the ability of user communities to collect, organize and
curate information on the Internet. Recently, a number of question and answer (Q&A) sites
have successfully built large growing knowledge repositories, each driven by a wide range of
questions and answers from its users community. While sites like Yahoo Answers have stalled
and begun to shrink, one site still going strong is Quora, a rapidly growing service that
augments a regular Q&A system with social links between users. Despite its success, however,
little is known about what drives Quora’s growth, and how it continues to connect visitors and
experts to the right questions as it grows.

- This paper presents the results of a detailed analysis of Quora using measurements and shed
light on the impact of three different connection networks (or graphs) inside Quora, a graph
connecting topics to users, a social graph connecting users, and a graph connecting related
questions. The results show that heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are significant
contributors to the quality of Quora’s knowledge base. One drives the attention and activity of
users, and the other directs them to a small set of popular and interesting questions.

- Limitations of the reference
	- Quora uses popups and interstitials to force users to login or register before they can see
	  more of the content, similar to a metered paywall.

---

### Reference 4 - Stack Overflow web application

- Stack Overflow is a question and answer website for professional and enthusiast programmers.
It is the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel
Spolsky. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming.
Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share
their programming knowledge, and build their careers.

- The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through
membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down similar to reedit
and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki. Users of Stack Overflow can earn
reputation points and "badges"; for example, a person is awarded 10 reputation points for
receiving an "up" vote on a question or an answer to a question, and can receive badges for
their valued contributions, which represents a gamification of the traditional Q&A website.
Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the ability to vote, comment,
and even edit other people's posts.

- As of March 2021 Stack Overflow has over 14 million registered users, and has received over
21 million questions and 31 million answers. Based on the type of tags assigned to questions,
the top eight most discussed topics on the site are: JavaScript, Java, C#, PHP, Android, Python,
jQuery, and HTML. Stack Overflow also has a Jobs section to assist developers in finding their
next opportunity. For employers, Stack Overflow provides tools to brand their business,
advertise their openings on the site, and source candidates from Stack Overflow's database of
developers who are open to being contacted.

- Limitations of Stack Overflow
	- This platform lacks to provide a feature for students from college to form local
	  communities and groups to connect with each other.

---

### Reference 5 - Quora web application

- Quora is an American question-and-answer website where questions are asked, answered,
followed, and edited by Internet users, either factually or in the form of opinions. Its owner,
Quora Inc., is based in Mountain View, California, United States. Quora is a place to gain and
share knowledge. It's a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute
unique insights and quality answers.

- In September 2018, Quora reported that it was receiving 300 million unique visitors every
month. Despite its large number of registered users, Quora did not possess the same level of
mainstream cultural dominance as sites like Twitter, which, at the time, had roughly 326
million registered users. This may have been because a large number of registered users on the
site did not use it regularly and many did not even know they had accounts since they had either
created them unknowingly through other social media sites linked to Quora or created them
years previously and forgotten about them.

-  Limitations of Quora:
	- Quora uses popups and interstitials to force users to login or register before they can see
	  more of the content, similar to a metered paywall.

### Reference 6 - React documentation

- React documentation provides the related resources to learn more about the React - JavaScript
library. People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles.
Whether we prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, React documentation provides
us with practical tutorials [9] to provide the opportunity of learning by doing. Or even prefer
to learn concepts step by step, we can start with the guide to main concepts.

- React documentation goes at a faster pace and introduces the most important React concepts in
a detailed, beginner-friendly way. The React documentation assumes some familiarity with
programming in the JavaScript language. This documentation always reflects the latest stable
version of React.

---

### Related Work

- A revised 2017 Research highlights the different problems defined to implement React in
market growth and popularity. These problems are mainly about (“big Development
Community”), (“React core Architecture”), (“React is fast and Agile”). They highlighted that
using React makes it easier to create interactive user interfaces. It efficiently updates through
rendering the exact components to the view of each state and makes the data changes in the
application.

- The next research on Firebase, It is a backend platform for building Web applications. It offers
a real time database, different APIs, multiple authentication types, hosting platform and much
more. Firebase frees developers to focus on crafting fantastic user experiences. They don’t need
to manage servers. You don’t need to write APIs. Firebase is your server, your API and your
data store, all written so generically that you can modify it to suit most needs. Overall, it has a
great deal of information providing surface knowledge on business benefits of SaaS. It has a
ton of useful features that can all be tuned and tweaked to power the back-end of
a SaaS application.

---

## Existing Work

- Some existing work on one of the features which the model directly or indirectly provides to
or rather highlights it to the viewers. Redux proprietary research topic in 2016 by Alex, a frontend
web developer emphasized its concentration on Redux; it is one of the hottest libraries in
front-end development these days. However, many people are confused about what it is and
what its benefits are.

- Majority of our works and discussions are raised on 2021.Community-based Question
Answering destinations enable users to find solutions to complex, point by point and individual
questions from different users. Be that as it may, since answering a question relies upon the
capacity and readiness of users to address the asker's needs, a huge portion of the questions
stay unanswered. A fresher just took admission in Jain University, does not know anything
about college and does not have any connection to others. He/ She can directly take our
application and can find out his/ her queries. If his / her query is not present then can post his/
her query here.

- System will ensure the students do not provide any fake answers or events through our site.
Students will be able to see the live events happening on campus. This research is also provided
with Comprehensive details about SDLC. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. In
detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development. In
this we can assign every team member to contribute their work separately through respective
phases.

---

## Problems in Existing system

- Here are the list of problems, some of them are already explained in related and existing work
	- Risk of mismanagement and of data when the project is under development.

	- It will be more complicated when new features associates with environment settings and
	  will become cost-bulky.

	- ReactJS standard framework reusing methods and services saves the programming effort
	  and improves reliability of the application.

	- Communication between customer and owner is not direct.

	- The complete hierarchy is not implemented manually.

	- A system can be developed to be precise and that will be used if install must still be a
	  good speculation for the organization.

	- Still will there be no hostility from the user that will undermine the promising application
	  benefits.

---

## Proposed System
- This addresses the demand of our project’s idea and those services help the participating
students or teachers to find better answers from so many queries and also learn about our
university in non-invasive ways.

- “JUQuery” is a platform for the purpose of knowing about the academic and non-academic
environment, campus life of a student, and faculty and student relationship of Jain University
in virtual way. This application provides us with complete information about campus life in
student point of view, academic information in college point of view.

- As stated, it provides guidance in following aspects,
	- It gives an entrancing view of the whole process and services of JUQuery web
	  application.
	- The structure of the measurement system is on the basis of the findings of an earlier stage
	  of the research that had resulted in the development of a number of process-based KPIs
	  and the key issues they encompass.
	- It follows Agile Methodology so get the benefits like Regular adaptation to changing
	  circumstances , Even late changes in requirements are welcomed,
	- And also testing practices have worked wonders for numerous organizations with
	  positive aspects.
	- On initial stages fire base provides an extensive help of a wide range of services and
	  features and it is well known for backend-as-a-service. It has a ton of useful features that
	  can all be tuned and tweaked to power the back-end of a SaaS application.

## System Design

### Architecture
<p>
<img src="assets/system-design/JU%20Query%20Architecture%20Diagram.jpeg" alt="Architecture" />
</p>

- After clicking any icon as given in the web page, through ReactJs it sends user to API call.
There API handler will do the authentication part combining with Firebase Authentication.
Also it uses Firestore Database to keep our all the data.

- Through our application the following actions to be performed which leads to a hassle free and
easy environment for “JUQuery” web application development,
1. It all starts with the decision on “what type of application needs to be developed for our
university and also based on the current business needs”. This is essential and acts as a base
for deciding what do agile users expect as an outcome and what kind of technology needs
to be included to achieve it. It also helps in further evaluation of cloud services that can be
used for achieving business logic.
2. Requirements for software are laid, which encompasses all types of requirements such as
mission, goal, scalability, audience, feature set, etc. This helps in gathering information
about users and market and how they react with each other creating demand for the
application. This is a part of MVP development scheme that is used in combination with
agile in this guide.
3. Then a thorough analysis is done on what kind of cloud provider will be best suited and
the decision for a provider is mainly based on cost, legal, and compliance.
4. Once the provider is decided, its platform is evaluated, and its services can help us to
achieve the solution. The main agenda is to look at what kind of web application is being
developed and which kind of target audience would be its market. This can bring clarity to
the services which needs to be put into action to achieve the development.
5. Agile development methodology is much more beneficial as compared to other traditional
software development methodologies.
6. As a part of Agile development, the team gets to choose the ReactJs and ReduxJS libraries.
The guide doesn’t specify the user to pick a specific one as depending on the type of
application and adaptation of the developers, any of the two can be picked and followed to
manage modules.
7. MVP or Minimum Viable Product is the correct balance of Minimum and Viability factor
which ensures proper interests of end users and also takes in the minimum amount of effort
that needs to be put in the development. Efforts here can be a replacement of cost,
scalability, mobility and sometimes even features. A product of MVP development method
is a subset of Minimum and Viable.

## Implementation

- "JUQuery" is a platform that provides us with complete information about campus life from a
student point of view, and academic information from a college point of view. It features a
familiar and well-thought-out and attractive user interface, much like posting a query, giving a
response to a query, helping a student through a personal chat if required.

- A user has complete freedom to post any query, and can also make a funny post in a legal way.
Also students can register/ host any campus related events and also can take the feedback from
other students through this platform. So, the following techniques have been taken into the
implementation of the web application:

### Functional programming using functional components
- Functional programming is a concept of creating pure functions for software logic.
- It avoids concepts of mutable data and a shared state as used in Object-oriented
programming. The functional programming is based more on expressions and declarations
rather than the statements.
- The functional programming depends only on the arguments passed to the function.
- In React, a functional component is a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX.
- In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed
by creating functions.
- Functional components lack a significant amount of features as compared to class-based
components. The gap is made up with the help of a special ReactJS concept called “hooks”.
Hooks are special functions that allow ReactJS features to be used in functional
components.
- So, in our project we have incorporated functional programming using functional components
where we pass data as shared state through functional arguments.

### State management using Redux.js library
- Redux is a predictable state container designed to help us write JavaScript apps that behave
consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test.
- With Redux, the state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can access
any state that it needs from this store.
- State management is essentially a way to facilitate communication and sharing of data
across components.
- It creates a tangible data structure to represent the state of your app that you can read from
and write to.
- As it's mostly used as a state management tool with React, we have taken advantage of it
to manage states of our platform event triggers such as user login/logout, show/hide popup,
user inputs to provide a user friendly experience.

### Specific re-rendering using ReactDOM in React.js
- In React every UI piece is a component, and each component has a state.
- React follows the observable pattern and listens for state changes.
- When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM tree.
- Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React then compares the current version of the
virtual DOM with the previous version of the virtual DOM. This process is called “diffing”.
- Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates only
those objects, in the real DOM.
- This makes the performance far better when compared to manipulating the real DOM
directly.
- This makes React standout as a high performance JavaScript library.
- ReactDOM.render() controls the contents of the container node you pass in. Any existing
DOM elements inside are replaced when first called. Later calls use React’s DOM diffing
algorithm for efficient updates.
- We have taken advantage of this React.js feature to re-render only those parts of the website
which require a refresh, saving a lot of data usage from the user' experience with our
platform.

### Secure API authentication using Firebase
- Firebase Authentication is an extensible token-based auth system and provides out-of-thebox
integrations with the most common providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter,
among others.
- It enables us to use custom claims which we’ll leverage to build a flexible role-based API.
- The Firebase API is secured via tokens—in order to generate such a token, we need to call
Firebase’s Client SDK and log in with a valid user/password credential.
- When successful, Firebase will send a token back in the response which we can then add
to the header of any following request we want to perform.
- We take leverage over this secure features of Firebase Authentication API to keep our users
secure and gain their trust over our platform's user experience
- Firebase gives us complete control over authentication by allowing you to authenticate
users or devices using secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
- We generate these tokens on your server, pass them back to a client device, and then use
them to authenticate via the signInWithCustomToken() method To reduce problems
promoting code changes from development to staging to production, instead of including
API keys in the code itself, either set them as environment variables or include them in a
configuration file.

### Real time fetching data using Firebase Firestore database
- Firebase data is retrieved by either a one-time call to GetValueAsync() or attaching to an
event on a Firebase Database reference.
- The event listener is called once for the initial state of the data and again anytime the data
changes.
- Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (Baas). It provides developers with a variety of tools
and services to help them develop quality apps, grow their user base, and earn profit.
- It is built on Google's infrastructure.
- It is categorized as a NoSQL database program, which stores data in JSON-like documents.
- Stores data as collections of documents.
- Simple data is easy to store in documents, which are very similar to JSON. Complex,
hierarchical data is easier to organize at scale, using sub collections within documents.
- Requires less denormalization and data flattening.
- Firestore also features richer, faster queries and scales further which is very helpful with
- Real time fetching of data from backend and rendering data on front-end with a very low
latency which makes the user experience very effective.
- This is how we have created the “JU Query” Web application, by using these technologies and
techniques along with testing each component of the codebase locally and in production using
in-built react-testing-library.
- For each feature, a React component is implemented to follow the separation of concern
principle which is connected together using Dependency injection and component re-rendering
to make coding implementation effective along with ease to extend and maintain in the future
making it scalable and flexible.
- This component structure provides the user with on-time delivery of update releases and
upgrades.

---

## Results and Discussion
- “JUQuery” web application is a deliverable for students and faculties of the college
incorporated with production-grade coding standards. This application is quite composite in
nature and requires certain technical prerequisites to understand the implementation used in the
background.
- The web application is intended for college students and faculties making them the target
audience for this platform and mainly focuses on promoting virtual interactions and helps each
and every student to know what is exactly going on the college campus.
- The technology stack used in the process of preparation of this:
	- HTML5
	- CSS3
	- JavaScript with ES6 features
	- NPM
	- React JS
	- Redux JS
	- React-testing-library
	- Material-UI
	- Git & GitHub
	- Firebase Firestore
	- Firebase Authentication
	- Firebase Deploy

## Conclusion and Future scope
- In this project, we have done an application that helps the students of a college to get to know
about their academic and non-academic information from the student’s perspective.
- And every student of the college can post any query they want to post and anyone who wants
to answer the post can do that. This process enables students across the campus even from
different departments to interact with each other and get collaborative knowledge.
